Presentation Deck

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
Monday 12/5 - TBD
Git Process
All documents and files associated with the project, other than out Task Tracker and Pitch Deck, will live on GitHub
Links to Task Tracker and Pitch Deck will be pinned in our Slack channel
All team members will be added to a new Git Organization and have access to the project repository
Git Flow
For development, we will make a working branch and merge all new features onto the working branch
Each team member or group will will create another branch specific to their feature for development
Before merging into the working branch, the team member/group will create a pull request and alert the team that a code review is necessary
Alerts will be sent out via Slack or Remo, depending on where the majority of the team is at the time
The pull request must be reviewed by a minimum of two other team members
Once the code has been reviewed, the team will merge the feature branch onto the working branch
Once all features are completed, the whole team will approve merging into the main branch
