- We’ll split the work into groups or individual parts. Each morning we’ll have a team meeting where we will cover what we did the previous day, and discuss with each other if anyone doesn’t understand what we’ve done, and then discuss what we’ll do going forward.

  - The offending team member will be allowed one more violation
   - On the third offense, team will escalate to a TA
